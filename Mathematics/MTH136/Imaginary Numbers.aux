Being a novice in the area of mathematics (rather, I am experienced, but not very skilled in the field), I was similarly puzzled at the idea of there being such a thing as an imaginary number. After all, if a number does not exist, why bother mentioning said number at all? If the number was so important, why did it not become a real number, rather than forcing countless students to learn how to work with such a seemingly silly number? I cannot say that I fully grasp the reason for needing imaginary numbers, but I do know how such numbers function.}{1}{}\protected@file@percent }
