	<p>I was tasked with selecting a topic, creating a simple HTML page, and (I think) talking about the subject. For the first of my assignments, I am going to describe something I have been reading about recently: fractal burning.</p>
	<p>The first time I heard of this type of woodworking technique, it was in the context of how dangerous the technique is, how easy it is to seriously injure yourself, or even kill yourself. I am not interested in dying prematurely, but I am a very curious person, so I decided to read up on the technique. A few months later, I am here, writing about my experience, and I am happy to report that I was able to get my setup working.</p>
	<p>But what is fractal burning? The simplest explanation is that fractal burning is a technique where a high-voltage power supply is attached to a piece of wood, the wood is soaked in a electrolytic solution, and the high-voltage burns a really cool pattern into the wood. For my setup, I purchased a transformer for a neon-sign, nailed it to a piece of scrap wood, and put it somewhere where it would not electrocute me, arc to anything in my workshop, or set fire to anything other than the piece of wood I am trying to work on. I have worked with high voltages before, but I have always used voltages that are too high to actually burn things (I cannot remember why electricity does not burn things after a certain voltage, I just know that this is the way it is). I am not really afraid of high voltage, but I am very careful around it. There are a bunch of weird ways that I could accidentally kill myself with electricty, such as touching a capacitor with a stored charge, electricity arcing to my body, or some kind of explosion (look up "arc flash"). I am not an electrician, I am just a nerd, and I have read a ton about this stuff, so I know the basic safety procedures (keep a hand behind my back or in my pocket, use the back of my hand if I have to touch a circuit, etc.). That being said, my lack of experience was apparent, especially when it took me two hours to realize that the transformer was shutting itself off because the wires were touching the ground. When I did get it working, it was incredibly satisfying, and I was amazed as I watched the electricity slowly burn patterns into the wood grain, burning deeper marks the longer the power was connected, while trying to form a connection between the two electrodes. It is a fascinating process, and I am really happy with how it turned out.</p>
