# Chapter 6: Atmospheric Moisture - Key Terms

Absolute humidity: the maximum amount of water vapor that can be in air at a given temperature

Environmental lapse rate: the average cooling rate for a specific location

Dry adiabatic rate: the rate at the temperature descreases as an unsaturated air parcel rises. The rate is 5.5 degrees (F) per 1000 feet (or 10C per 1000 meters). This rate is otherwise known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate.

Lifting condensation level: the lifting condensation level (LCL) is the altitude where condensation begins to occur. When an air parcel reaches the LCL, the parcel saturates, condensation begins, and clouds begin to form.

Relative humidity: a ratio of the actual water vapor content of the air compared with the amount that the air can actually hold

Saturated adiabiatic rate: the rate at which the temperature of a saturated air parcel decreases as said parcel rises. The average saturated adiabatic rate is 3.3F per 1000 feet (or 6C per 1000 meters).

Specific humidity: the mass of water vapor in a given mass of air

Vapor pressure: the pressure exerted by water vapor in Earth's atmosphere

Water vapor capacity: the maximum amount of water vapor that can be in air a given temperature
