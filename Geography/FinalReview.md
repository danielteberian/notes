# FINAL REVIEW

This is my review for the final exam that I have in my geography class. I will try to explain the questions that I am using to review the concepts from the class, but I am not as concerned with explaining the questions as I am with doing well on my final. Without further ado, let us begin.


### Seven Important Latitudes:
1. Equator (0 degrees)
2. Tropic of Cancer (23.5 N)
3. Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 S)
4. Arctic Circle (66.5 N)
5. Antartic Circle (66.5 S)
6. North Pole (90 N)
7. South Pole (90 S)

### Descriptive Zones of Latitude:
1. Low latitude: The area between the equator and 30 degrees (both North and South).
2. Midlatitude: The area between 30 and 60 degrees (both North and South).
3. High latitude: Latitudes that are greater than 60 degrees (both North and South).
4. Equatorial: Area that is within a few degrees of the equator.
5. Tropical: The area within the tropics (23.5 degrees, North and South).
6. Subtropical: The area at around 25-30 degrees (both North and South), closer to the tropics ("slightly poleward").
7. Polar: The area that is within a few degrees of the North/South Poles.

### "The Geographic Grid"
The globe consists of two major components:
1. Parallels - A series of lines that run horizontally, parallel to the equator.
2. Meridians - A series of vertical lines, with each being 15 degrees from the previous meridian. These lines DO NOT run parallel to the Prime Meridian. These lines converge at the poles, and are furthest apart at the equator.

It is worth mentioning that meridians will cross parallels at right angles (right, as in 90 degree angles, not correct angles).

Latitude is the measure of distance from the equator. This distance is measured in degrees N/S of the equator. In other words, latitude uses parallels, which are the horizontal lines on the globe.

Conversely, longitude is the distance from the Prime Meridian, using the meridians. The distance is measured in degrees E/W of the Prime Meridian. In other words, Longitude uses meridians, which are the vertical lines on the globe.

Latitude is measured on a scale of 0-90 degrees, either North or South. Longitude is measured on a scale of 0-180 degrees, either East or West.


### Earth's Rotation
The earth rotates from WEST to EAST, on its axis. A complete rotation requires 24 hours.

During rotation, all the parts of Earth's surface are moved, except for the poles. Except for the poles, all parts of Earth's surface are moving in a circle, along the axis of the planet.

The rotation speed varies by location, but it never changes in a location. For example, New York City will rotate at the same speed today as it has since it formed (I do not know how New York City came to be, and such a topic is irrelevant to the subject at hand).

The rotation of the earth has the following effects:
1. The earth's rotation causes the "diurnal" (from the Latin diurnalis, meaning "daily") alternation between light and darkness.
2. (something that does not matter to me)
3. (something else that does not matter to me)

NOTE: Rotation is NOT the same as a revolution! The earth ROTATES on its axis, and the earth REVOLVES around the sun.


### Telling Time, Using Location
Time moves AHEAD the further East one goes.
In order for the earth to rotate completely, it must turn 360 degrees. Given how a day is 24 hours long, and the earth must rotate 360 degrees, each 15 degrees represents one hour.


### The Vertical Structure of the Atmosphere
In order of highest to lowest:
5. Exosphere
4. Thermosphere
3. Mesosphere
2. Stratosphere
1. Troposphere
