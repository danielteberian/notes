# Cloud Classification

Clouds are classified based on two major factors: (1) form, and (2) altitude.

## Form
There are three forms that are used to classify clouds. Each of these forms share the same suffix (-iform), which can be (roughly) translated as "shape". The three (3) forms of clouds are as follow:

#### 1. Cirriform
Cirriform is used to describe clouds that are thin and wispy. Cirriform clouds (known as cirrus clouds) are made up of ice crystals, and are generally found at high altitudes.

#### 2. Stratiform
Statiform is used to describes clouds that resemble large, gray(ish) sheets of cloud, which cover large areas of the sky. The next time that there is a cloudy day wherever you live, go outside and look at the sky. You are (most likely) looking at a stratus cloud. Occasionally, these clouds are broken up into seperate clouds.

#### 3. Cumuliform
Cumuliform is used to describe clouds that are round and puffy. These clouds, known as cumulus clouds, generally have flat bases, and are generally taller than they are wide. These clouds are what most children would draw if one asked them to draw clouds.



## Altitude

1. High clouds - Above 20,000 feet (6km)
2. Middle clouds - between 6,500 and 20,000 feet (2-6 km)
3. Low clouds - below 6,500 feet (2km)
