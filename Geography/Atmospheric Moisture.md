# Atmospheric Moisture
This is a document that I have written in order to better understand what I have been studying for a class that I am taking. I have become incredibly irritated with how poorly Pearson's textbooks have been written, how overly complicated their explanations are, how long their sentences go on for (I am aware of the irony of this portion of my statement), and how every single concept that they write about is made boring and hard to understand. Unfortunately, Pearson is used in many schools, so we are stuck with them. I hope that the concepts I am going to explain will be easier to understand, and that it is not too boring to read my explanation for each of them. God bless, and I wish you all the best of luck in studying!


# 1. Water, and how it changes state
Water is good, and many believe that water is vital to human life. I could go on for a while about the importance of water, but I am already low on time, so I must get to the point of this explanation.

Water exists in various states. There is a solid form of water (ice), a liquid form of water (water), and a gas form of water (water vapor). Let us examine the three states that I have just mentioned, in the order that I have mentioned them.

### Ice
Ice is the solid form of water. On a molecular level, the water molecules are bonded together, but they are further apart than water in a liquid state. Because of how far apart the water molecules are, ice has a lower density than water.

### Water
When ice melts, 80 calories are absorbed. Furthermore, when ice turns to water, some of the bonds between water molecules are broken, and the molecules are pushed closer together. Because of the area between water molecules being reduced, the density of water is greater than than of ice.

### Water Vapor
When what evaporates, it absorbs around 600 calories, and the process results in the creation of water vapor. Water vapor, on a molecular level, is pretty wild. The water molecules are no longed bonded together, and the molecules go all over the place.


## State-changes
Here are the 6 forms state-changes that can take place with water:

### 1. Melting
Melting takes place when ice turns to water (solid to liquid), which absorbs 80 calories.

### 2. Freezing
Freezing takes place when water turns to ice (liquid to solid), which released 80 calories.

### 3. Evaporation
Evaporation takes place when water becomes water vapor (liquid to gas), which absorbs around 600 calories.

### 4. Condensation
Condensation takes place when water vapor becomes water (gas to liquid), which releases around 600 calories.

### 5. Sublimation
Sublimation is one of two state-changes that skip over a state. Sublimation is where ice turns to water vapor (solid to gas), which absorbs around 680 calories.

### 6. Deposition
Deposition is the second of two state-changes that skip a state. Deposition is where water vapor turns to ice (gas to solid), which releases around 680 calories.



## 2. Air Parcels
Air parcels are fairly strange, as they have no definite volume. A foot is 12 inches, a mile is 5,280 feet, but an air parcel is an indefinite volume of air. My class notes describe an air parcel as "[a]n imaginary volume of air containing air molecules, water vapor etc.[sic]". As for how an air parcel is different from air is beyond me, but who am I to question the science?

Despite air parcels being of an indefinite volume, the American Meteorological Society often measures air parcels as a cubic foot of air. I am not sure how somebody can define something that is (according to what I have read) undefinable, so make of this information what you will.



## 3. Humidity
Humidity is the word that is used to describe the amount of water vapor that is in the air. If the amount of water vapor in the air increases, so does the level of humidity.

Imagine that you have a cup in front of you (it may be hard to imagine such a fantastic situation, but please, do your best). What if I poured some water into the cup that is in front of you? Well, the cup would hold the water. What if I poured more water into the cup? The amount of water that the cup is holding will increase as I pour more water. However, there is a limit to how much water can be held in this cup.

Now, rather than imagining a cup, imagine one of those imaginary air parcels that we just learned about. If I pour water into the air, the water goes onto the floor. When the water goes onto the floor, my mother will be very upset with me. This cannot work. However, if I boil the water, the water vapor will be absorbed into the air. Nice!

As with the cup, the air can only hold so much water. The amount of water vapor that can be held by the air is what is known as "water vapor capacity".

When an air parcel is holding as much water vapor as it can, the air parcel becomes "saturated". In other words, a saturated air parcel is one that has no more room to hold water vapor.



## 4. Measuring Humidity
There are three (3) ways to measure humidity:

### 4a. Vapor pressure
Actual vapor pressure is the pressure of water vapor in a parcel of air. The actual vapor pressure will increase as the number of water vapor molecules (in an air parcel) increases. Conversely, as the number of water vapor molecules in a parcel of air decrease, so does the actual vapor pressure.

There is also what is known as "saturation vapor pressure". While actual vapor pressure is used to measure the amount of vapor pressure in an air parcel, saturation vapor pressure is used to measure the amount of pressure that would be produced if a given air parcel was saturated, at a specific temperature.

In short, actual vapor pressure is the measurement of the amount of vapor pressure in a given air parcel. Saturation vapor pressure is the amount of vapor pressure that would be produced IF a given air parcel was saturated.

### 4b. Specific Humidity
Specific humidity is the mass of water vapor that is present in a given mass of air. In other words, the specific humidity is the amount of water vapor that exists in a defined amount of air.

In order to calculate the specific humidity, one must do the following:
1. Find the mass of the water vapor.
2. Add the mass of air and the mass of the vapor.
3. Divide the mass of the water vapor by the sum of the masses of air and vapor. Basically, divide what you got from step 1 by what you got from step 2.

### 4c. Relative Humidity
Relative humidity describes how much of the total capacity of a parcel of air has been filled with water vapor.
