# Studying Checklist
I love learning about new things, and I am currently too busy to study all of the things that I want to study, so I have decided to create this list. I will come back and write about these topics (maybe) whenever I get around to reading about them:

## To Study
- Electricity
- Leatherworking
- Glassblowing
- Cars
- How computer components work, and how to create my own
- Biblical Greek (Koine)
