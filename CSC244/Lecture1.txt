## Basic functions of computers
The basic functions of a computer are inputting data, outputting data, processing data, and storing data. Data, data, data, data.

## The components of a computer
The main components of a computer include the memory, the input devices, the output devices, the datapath, and the control.

### Memory
The memory stores the instructions and data for a given program.

### Input devices
Input devices, such as computer mice, keyboards, microphones, MIDI shenannigans, and so on, write data to the memory.

## Output devices
Output devices, such as displays, printers, speakers, and other stuff like that, read data from the memory (and, presumably, share that data with the user).

## Datapath
Datapath processes data via a collection of functional units, such as ALU (arithmetic logic units), registers, internal buses, and so on.

## Control
The control sends signals to determine the operations of the datapath, memory, input devices, and output devices.


## Abstraction layers
Abstraction layers are, to put things simply, degrees of seperation between the lowest level of computing and where the user is.
